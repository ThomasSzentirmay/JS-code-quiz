# Project Title

JavaScript Coding Quiz

# Project Description

This project is a 10-question quiz that tests your JavaScript knowledge! User's have 60 seconds to answer all 10 answers correctly, and with each incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be taken from the timer, leaver you with less time to complete it! Once the user ends the quiz, win or loss, they have the chance to enter their initials, and have their score recorded in the 'High Scores' box.

The technologies used in the project are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The challenges I faced building this project were mostly to do with the logic behind the functionality of everything. I often found myself reffering to online resources to remind me of certain functions and method names so that I could carry out the tasks I wanted done. I also used so things I have never touched before which was scary but exciting!

ChatGPT was a great resource that I used to help make my code precise, and also help me check for errors in the debugging process.
